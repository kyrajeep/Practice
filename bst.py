#implement a binary search tree
#approximate the square root of a number?
# x * x = x^2
# why would you use a binary search for that? -> this is brilliant. 
# I think as I solve more problems it becomes more natural to think this way
# how would I write test cases
 # with integers I already know the answer to
# input: number n
# output: the square root 
# can I do a small example?
# what would be a suitable small example?
# if s * s = x then s is the output (solution)
# if s * s > x then solution < s
# if s * s < x then solution > s


# test cases : n = 4, sol = 2
# n = 8, sol = math.floor(math.sqrt(8))
# does the answer have to be an integer?
# If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).
# 3 things to check. should I delegate it to a helper function
# there are three different responses depending on the output of this helper
# is n a global?
# how to respond to this helper
# should I create a class, a blueprint to print this out again and again?
